# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights into the healthy-bites React + Vite application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` package (v1.0.2)
- Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with dependency tree

### 2. Code Integration
**Modified: `src/App.jsx`**
- Added import statement for SpeedInsights component from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component at the end of the App component, after the Footer
- Placement ensures the tracking script loads on all routes without interfering with routing

### 3. Implementation Details
- Framework: React (Create React App style with Vite)
- Integration type: Component-based using `@vercel/speed-insights/react`
- The SpeedInsights component is placed inside the CartProvider wrapper to ensure it has access to the full React context
- Positioned after the Footer component to maintain visual layout while allowing performance tracking

### 4. Testing
- ✅ Build completed successfully (npm run build)
- ✅ No new lint errors introduced
- ✅ Package installed without dependency conflicts
- ✅ All routes maintain their functionality with the new component

## Next Steps
Once deployed to Vercel:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard for this project
2. The `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` script will be automatically loaded
3. Performance metrics will start being collected after deployment
4. Data can be viewed in the Speed Insights tab of the Vercel dashboard

## Files Modified
- `client/package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `client/package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree
- `client/src/App.jsx` - Added SpeedInsights component and import

## Notes
- The implementation follows the official Vercel documentation for React applications
- The SpeedInsights component is lightweight and won't impact application performance
- Pre-existing lint errors in the codebase (CartContext.jsx, Checkout.jsx, Menu.jsx) are unrelated to this implementation
